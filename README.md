# RL-for-Trading-Bot
This project builds a fully functioning reinforcement learning system that trades through historical market data. The agent learns a trading policy by interacting with a simulated environment, receiving rewards based on gains and losses, and continuously improving its Q-value estimates through Double DQN training.
